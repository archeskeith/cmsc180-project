# Project Details

**Author:** _Keith Nicole M. Arches_

**Programming language:** C

**Operating System:** Windows 10

**Dependencies Used:**
- _Ubuntu Terminal_ - used for running/executing the program
- _gcc_ - used for making the program/code compatible to run on any OS Environment.


**Installation for Dependencies:**
- _Ubuntu Terminal/Any other Terminal_: `They're usually pre-built either on Windows/Linux, one just have to make sure that gcc is available.`

**How to Run the Program? (Binary Search)**
`1) On the terminal, type "gcc binarysearch.c -pthread`

`2) Type "time ./a.out"`

`3) Type the size of the array.`

`Note: The code was not automated, since each function would need to use the time command from C individually. As such, in order to check each and every function/tasks, one must comment/uncomment the functions on the "main" function.`

**How to Run the Program? (DFS)**
`1) On the terminal, type "gcc dfs.c -pthread`

`2) Type "time ./a.out"`

`3) Type the size of the matrix.`

`Note: The code was not automated, since each function would need to use the time command from C individually. As such, in order to check each and every function/tasks, one must comment/uncomment the functions on the "main" function.`
